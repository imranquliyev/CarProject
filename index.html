That seems to be the question on everyone's mind. Well, we have an idea. Cars are for people who want to go to more places safely and efficiently</p>

                <p>At the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Toyota is demo’ing it’s idea of the “Future of Mobility”. As has become plainly obvious over the last couple years, Toyota believes plug-in vehicles will fail and that fuel cell EV’s are the future. While other companies are at CES showing off battery based EV’s, Toyota is sticking with their fuel cells.</p>

Lines flow from the center of the dashboard throughout the vehicle, while Yui travels around them, using light, sound and even touch to communicate critical information. It utilizes a single wide-screen, 3-D, full-color Head-Up Display that blends into an interior that is clean and uncluttered.</p>
